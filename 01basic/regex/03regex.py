Sets
A set is a set of characters inside a pair of square brackets [] with a special meaning:

Set	Description	
[arn]	Returns a match where one of the specified characters (a, r, or n) is present	
[a-n]	Returns a match for any lower case character, alphabetically between a and n	
[^arn]	Returns a match for any character EXCEPT a, r, and n	
[0123]	Returns a match where any of the specified digits (0, 1, 2, or 3) are present	
[0-9]	Returns a match for any digit between 0 and 9	
[0-5][0-9]	Returns a match for any two-digit numbers from 00 and 59	
[a-zA-Z]	Returns a match for any character alphabetically between a and z, lower case OR upper case	
[+]	In sets, +, *, ., |, (), $,{} has no special meaning, so [+] means: return a match for any + character in the string
